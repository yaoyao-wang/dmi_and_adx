## 1. What is What is the DMI and ADX?

The indicator is made up for three lines.
+DMI :It is the sum of the +DM(the Positive Directional Indicator) in recent 7 days.+DM represents the positive trend value, that is, the upward trend value, its value is equal to the highest price of the day minus the highest price of the previous day.

-DMI :It is the sum of the -DM(the Negative Directional Indicator) in the recent 7 days.﹣DM stands for negative trend change value, that is, downward trend value, its value is equal to the lowest price of the previous day minus the lowest price of the day.

ADX :The average directional index (ADX) is a technical analysis indicator used by some traders to determine the strength of a trend. The trend can be either up or down and can help assess whether a trade should be taken long or short.


## 2. What does the DMI and ADX tell you? 

### · +DMI/-DMI Bull/Bear Trend

#### Bull Trend when +DMI > -DMI

If the +DMI is larger than the -DMI, the trend will be upward and means that the buying power in the market is released. Therefore, it is going to be a bull market.

#### Bear Trend when -DMI > +DMI

If the -DMI is larger than the +DMI, the trend will be downward and is going to be a bear market.

### · ADX Trend Strength

The ADX is the simple moving average of the DX in the period. The DX can be calculated as the difference between +DI and -DI divide the sum of these two values.
If the ADX is larger than 15 and is increasing, it shows a strong trend.
If it is smaller than 15, it shows no trend.
(Normally, the guide recommends using ADX as 25, but we use ADX as 15 because the SPY trend strength is relatively smaller in the bull market.)
When the ADX turns down from high values, then the trend may be ending.
